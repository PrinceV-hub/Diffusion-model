# Diffusion Model for Denoising CIFAR-10 Images

This project uses a diffusion-based model to denoise images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It demonstrates the process of training a U-Net model, adding noise to images over time, and then reversing the process to recover the original image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- tqdm
